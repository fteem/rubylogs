I like exploring and learning about design patterns. In fact, I love learning
everything that can/will make my everyday work easier. I don't know if I am lazy
or it's just my struggle to be effective as much as I can, but I really enjoy
experimenting with them. It would be nice if we could all learn all the patterns
and then easily implement them. But then, our job would be really easy and we
couldn't brag that we are programmers and programming is hard.

But anyway, having the knowledge and foresight about when and where a design pattern can be used is
only achievable with lots of work. So, yesterday I noticed [this post on RubyFlow](http://www.rubyflow.com/p/2gu70l-examples-of-ruby-patterns)
about the State Pattern. Lets dive in, tear it apart and see how we can implement it using Ruby.
