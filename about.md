### Welcome to Ruby/Logs

Ruby/Logs is a blog with focus on Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Object-Oriented Design, 
Open Source technologies and everything in between. 

My name is Ilija Eftimov, but you can call me Ile. Everyone does.

I am the author of Rubylogs.com. My day job is as a full-stack Ruby on Rails developer, 
working for [Siyelo](http://siyelo.com){:target="_blank"}.

In my spare time, I am the author of [couple of tiny Ruby gems](https://rubygems.org/profiles/fteem), 
I am one of the organizers of Rails Girls in Macedonia and I am a part-time programming tutor.

You can find me on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/{{site.theme.twitter}}">Twitter</a>,
